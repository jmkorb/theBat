        Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. I'm Batman I'll be standing where l belong. 
        Between you and the peopIe of Gotham. I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.

        I'm Batman. A hero can be anyone, even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended. The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. 
        And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.
